Revision history for Perl module HTML::CalendarMonthSimple

Changes in 1.01: Added VALIGN to cells, to make alignment work with browsers better. Added showweekdayheaders(). Corrected a bug that results in the month not fitting on the grid (e.g. March 2003).  Added getdatehref() and setdatehref(). Corrected a bug that causes a blank week to be printed at the beginning of some months.

Changes in 1.02: Added the color methods.

Changes in 1.03: More color methods!

Changes in 1.04: Added the "which weekday" capability to addcontent(), setcontent(), and getcontent()

Changes in 1.05: addcontent(), et al can now take strings such as '06' or decimals such as '3.14' and will handle them correctly.

Changes in 1.06: Changed the "which weekday" interface a bit; truncations such as "2Tue" no longer work, and must be spelled out entirely ("2Tuesday"). Added "plural weekdays" support (e.g. "wednesdays" for "every wednesday").

Changes in 1.07: Fixed a typo that caused an entirely empty calendar to be displayed very small.

Changes in 1.08: Re-did the bugfixes described in 1.05, handling padded and non-integer dates.

Changes in 1.09: Fixed the "2Monday", et al support; a bug was found by Dale Wellman <dwellman@bpnetworks.com> where the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days weren't properly computing which Nth weekday they were so "1Monday" wouldn't work if the first Monday was the 7th of the month.

Changes in 1.10: Added the headercontentcolor(), weekendheadercontentcolor(), and weekdayheadercontentcolor() methods, and made content headers use bgcolors, etc properly.

Changes in 1.11: The module's VERSION is now properly specified, so "use" statements won't barf if they specify a minimum version. Added the vcellalignment() method so vertical content alignment is independent of horizontal alignment.

Changes in 1.12: Fixed lots of warnings that were generated if B<-w> was used, due to many values defaulting to undef/blank. Added the sharpborders(), nowrap(), cellheight(), cellclass(), and weekdayheadersbig() methods. cellclass(), the beginning of CSS support. Thanks, Bray!

Changes in 1.13: Added more CSS methods: headerclass(), weekdaycellclass(), weekndcellclass(), todaycellclass(). Added a test to the module distribution at the urging of CPAN testers.

Changes in 1.14: Added the contentfontsize() method.

Changes in 1.15: Added the datecolor(), datecontentcolor(), datebordercolor(), and datecellclass() methods, allowind cosmetic attributes to be changed on a per-date basis.

Changes in 1.16: Fixed a very stupid bug that made addcontent() and setcontent() not work. Sorry!

Changes in 1.17: Corrected B<-w> warnings about uninitialized values in as_HTML().

Changes in 1.18: Added methods: tableclass(), sunday(), saturday(), weekdays(). Now day names can be internationalized!

Changes in 1.19: Fixed as_HTML() such that blank/0 values can be used for various values, e.g. border size, colors, etc. Previously, values had to be non-zero or they were assumed to be undefined.

Ver 1.20 was a mistake on my part and was immediately superseded by 1.21.

Changes in 1.21: Fixed the internals of setcontent() et al (see the method's doc for details). Made getdatehref(), setdatehref(), and datecolor() et al, able to handle weekdays in addition to numeric dates.

Changes in 1.22: Added the much-desired weekstartsonmonday() method. Now weeks can start on Monday and end with the weekend, instead of the American style of starting on Sunday.

Changes in 1.23: Added today_year() et al. "Today" can now be overridden in the constructor.

Changes in 1.24: Minor corrections to the HTML so it passes XML validation. Thanks a bundle, Peter!

Changes in 1.25: A minor typo correction. Nothing big.

Changes in 1.26: Added highlight (RT-3899) and Days_in_Month (RT-58547) methods.
